## Usage

## Why not use Backbone?

- No deps
- Can be retrofitted into a parts of a legacy system, it's not a religion
- Serverside has been considered from the start
- It doesn't care how you manage your data
- Modules are designed to be reused in multiple contexts, you create layouts, not fixed views
- A little more structured than Backbone
